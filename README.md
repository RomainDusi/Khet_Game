# Khet_Game

## What is Khet Game ?

It was a school project, we had to reprogram the Khet game and be able to :
- Play all 3 starting configurations
- Implement additionals addons like seeing possible destinations for the pieces
- Create your own configuration and save it

For those who are not familiar with the Khet Game you can find an explanation here :

Please note that we changed pieces images, you can find them in the "images" folder.

It is currently in french but feel free to use it or modify it as you need =P

Enjoy !
